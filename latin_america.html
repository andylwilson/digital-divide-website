        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>To give a brief introduction to the idea of the digital divide, I think a quote from Eric Roberts, professor at Standford University, can be useful in providing a great foundation.</p>
        <p id="quote"><em>“The ability to access computers and the internet has become increasingly important to completely immerse oneself in the economic, political, and social aspects of not just America, but of the world. However, not everyone has access to this technology. The idea of the "digital divide" refers to the growing gap between the underprivileged members of society, especially the poor, rural, elderly, and handicapped portion of the population who do not have access to computers or the internet; and the wealthy, middle-class, and young Americans living in urban and suburban areas who have access.”</em> --Prof. Eric Roberts, Stanford University</p>

        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        
        <p>In the subsequent sections, we hope to further flesh out and detail the idea of the digital divide and how it affects different parts of the world in numerous ways, adapting our white paper research for more digital-friendly consumption.</p>

            <p>Over the past 20 years we’ve seen the web grow in ways many never could have imagined, and access to it has likewise grown at a substantial pace. As of 2013 98% of Americans claimed to have access to the internet. This is an amazing number, unfortunately, only 1 in 4 have access to it at home. So who is more likely to have access to the internet at home? If you guessed the well educated and wealthy, you are 100% correct. According to 2013 census data, affluent households had 80 - 90 percent home internet adoption rates while low income households were around 50 percent.

            Even when age is accounted for, a 90 year old with a six figure household income is substantially more likely to have home internet access than a person from any age group making less than $26k a year. A telling figure that highlights economic status as the key factor in having sufficient access to high speed internet at home, although it is not the only one.

            <p>
            Education, too, is a significant factor in telling who has home access to internet. Amongst those with a bachelor’s degree rates of home internet adoption are at 90%. The lower the rung on the education ladder you occupy, the the lower the chances you have a sufficiently robust home internet experience; rates taper off and drop precipitously for those without a high school degree, where 43% have access at home, a nearly 50% discrepancy from those with higher education. Of course there is a correlation between higher education and salary, so really this shouldn’t come as any surprise knowing what we already know.

            Race is also a factor, although the gap between minorities and the majority has been narrowing over the years, there are still obvious disparities. Asians have the highest rates of adoption at 87% followed by Whites at 77%; Blacks and Native Americans have the lowest rates of adoption at 61% and 58% respectively, while Hispanics are in the middle at a 67% adoption rate. Much has been said and written about racial discrepancies in the United States, and the numbers of home internet adoption essentially mirror them, so I will refrain here, but it is important to take into consideration when considering who are the “haves” and “have nots” of our “digital society.”

            Finally, where you live is a major determining factor. Much of the rural United States has significantly fallen behind the urban “core” of the country, especially in the southern states. Mississippi, the nation’s poorest state, has an incredible 43% of residents reporting no access to internet at home. This “rural/urban divide” may prove to be the most challenging hurdle to overcome as undeveloped rural areas with low rates of education, industry and income are not desirable locations for private companies to spend their resources further developing the infrastructure.

            Numerous initiatives have been implemented, both public and private to narrow the gap, and in many ways they have been resoundingly successful. Some notable initiatives have been a 2.3 billion dollar allocation by President Clinton in 2000 to provide low income areas broadband internet access; in 2003 a 250 million dollar contribution by the Gates Foundation that provided 11,000 libraries over the nation with over 47,000 computers and librarian training; The 76 billion dollar Broadband Access program and 57 million dollars in grants provided for the Community Connect program are the foundational pillars in the nation’s efforts to connect rural America; and the 2012 Obama administration ConnectED Initiative, whose goal is to provide 99% of schools and libraries with high speed internet are just a few examples of how the Government, private sectors and philanthropists have recognized the importance of a digitally connected nation.
