        Latin America

        <p>When talking about South America, the digital divide changes drastically. According to a pool made in 2012 the lowest digital divide amount all latin america country is Chile. 42.1% of Chile’s population have internet access, followed by Brazil with 38.1%. When compared to first world countries, developing countries from latin america have a bigger gap to fill and a bigger challenge ahead. Unlike China and North America the biggest problem leading to a digital divide in Latin America is mostly a matter of poverty. As shown in the graphic below, the average price of a mobile broadband plan in Latin America is the third most expensive in the world when comparing with the typical monthly income.
        </p>
        
        <p>Almost half of the all latin american adults are disconnected in terms of internet access. But just like cited on the digital divide in USA, the digital divide in South America changes drastically when analysing by income. According to a poll made by University of Southern California, in Colombia “residential adoption in the lowest income decile is only 11.4 percent, climbing steadily thereafter to reach 74.3 among the wealthiest 10 percent.” That is a cruel mirror image of the high social inequality highly presented in every Latin American country. According to an article from Oxfam, Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. They said that “In 2014 the richest 10% of people in Latin America had amassed 71% of the region’s wealth. If this trend continues, according to Oxfam’s calculations, in just six years’ time the richest 1% in the region will have accumulated more wealth than the remaining 99%”. In other other words the number of poor people by far outnumbers the number of rich ones, increasing this digital gap even more. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Fortunately, things are already improving. According to a newer poll from ECLAC released in 2016 the gap is closing. They show that the proportion of the population with internet access grew 10.6% from 2000 to 2015, reducing the gap in Latin American in a way never seen before. Moreover, according to GSMA Studies also show that mobile users tend do grow 50% until 2020.
        </p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, as developers we must take into consideration who we are reaching. At home in America we have the potential to reach nearly the entire population as cell phones, government incentives, and philanthropic enterprises have created unprecedented access for the American population.
        In contrast in the developing world we may only be getting through to a much smaller (and wealthier) section of the society, or oppressive totalitarian regimes may block or censor our work entirely. With all of that being said, much of the developing world is catching up and with more access comes a larger audience, so we must be prepared to serve potentially billions of more people as the globe becomes more connected every day.
