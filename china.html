        <h1>China</h1>
        <p>When discussing the digital divide, there is perhaps no greater example of the disparity between the “haves” and “have-nots” than in China. This should be of particular concern to us, if not from a moral standpoint, at the very least as web developers, whose addressable market growth potential is so heavily weighted on the emerging audiences in markets like China; massive populations of people who are just coming online for the first time. But the environment that they are being brought into is one of massive class, economic, geographic, and of particular note in China’s case, political strife.
        </p>
        <p >It’s impossible to talk about China’s digital divide without talking about The Great Firewall --that is, China’s major initiative to restrict and censure the greater Internet from its people. It is a wide-ranging system where by the Chinese government is able to police and censor the web, thanks to a system of state-owned ISPs that are required to comply with the regulations, blocking access to most western media, from Google, to Facebook, to Wikipedia.</p>
        
        <p id="quote"><em>“More than two million people in China are employed by the government to monitor web activity” noting that the state said they were “strictly to gather and analyse public opinions on microblog sites and compile reports for decision-makers”</em> --BBC</p>
    
        <p>When you add up the numbers, just over half of the population in China now has access to the Internet (55.8%), or at least China’s version of it, as you can see in the chart above. Contrast this with much of the rest of the developed world, as shown below, and you can see that China’s situation of access is a logistical problem that encompasses all of these aspects, all of which present challenges to our work as developers trying to access such a massive market. Even despite the significantly smaller percentage of its people with Internet access, China still accounts for the largest Internet market at 800 million, and considering that market has room to grow twice as large, we as developers and the industry at large would be wise to find ways to help those users join the wider Internet, for the benefit of not just us, but to bring equality of information to a great portion of the world’s population.

         <p>Much like in America, geography is a dramatic indicator of access to the Internet, or lack thereof, showing a great statistical divide between percentages of Internet users in urban environments versus rural residents. According to the China Internet Network Information Center, the department within China’s Ministry of Information that tracks Internet usage data, just 27% of China’s residents in rural areas had access to the Internet, in stark contrast to 73% of urban residents having access. This difference is made all the more troubling when you consider that 43% of the population in China still lives in rural areas (though that percentage has dramatically decreased from 1980 to 2016, when 81% of Chinese residents lived in rural areas).
