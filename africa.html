        <h1>Africa</h1>
        <p>Africa is one of the first biggest continent in the world with 11.7 million square miles and total amount of people more than 1.29 billion people. Africa has a lot of natural resources that can put all of the African countries at the beginning of the top countries list. And despite of this fact most of African countries are still considered as part of the third world countries. Many factors lead to this situation, such as: political, economy, lack of education, gender issues, race issues, and disabilities 
        </p>
        <p >Even as technology becomes more affordable and internet access seems increasingly ubiquitous, a “digital divide” between poor and rich, female and male, people with special needs.. etc. still extremely exist in Africa.  The spread of social media, especially Facebook, across Africa for the purposes of socializing, reporting, campaigning and communication and dissemination of information has been noticeable.

        <p>Due to the bad economy situation for most of African countries the individuals and communities don’t have access to computers, internet or even in some cases mobile phones. The devices and services are very expensive for most of them. The world’s most expensive fixed line broadband services are to be found in the western African state of Burkina Faso, where the average monthly cost of a broadband package is around $965 (£730) (Varallyai, Herdon, Botos, 2017), putting internet access out of reach of all but the wealthiest members of the country’s elite, according to a survey.

         <p>Much like in America, geography is a dramatic indicator of access to the Internet, or lack thereof, showing a great statistical divide between percentages of Internet users in urban environments versus rural residents. According to the China Internet Network Information Center, the department within China’s Ministry of Information that tracks Internet usage data, just 27% of China’s residents in rural areas had access to the Internet, in stark contrast to 73% of urban residents having access. This difference is made all the more troubling when you consider that 43% of the population in China still lives in rural areas (though that percentage has dramatically decreased from 1980 to 2016, when 81% of Chinese residents lived in rural areas).
